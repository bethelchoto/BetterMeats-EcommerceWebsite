# Project Title

BetterMeats E-commerce Website 

## Description

An e-commerce website that will help to give the local meat production farmers with a platform for their meat and storage facilities for their meat. So, the farmers will be registering to the platform, and when there provide meat to the storage, we will help them with a reliable market using the e-commerce website.
In an era of digital transformation, "Butcher Shop Express" is a pioneering e-commerce platform dedicated to modernizing the traditional butcher industry. This project strives to optimize customer interactions, improve operational efficiency, and foster a direct connection between consumers and local butcher businesses.
